        There are ${allRoles.length} roles, and you only be able to have one at a time.
        Those roles has no other additional permission and basically exist as placeholders. 
        While it's exist as a MERELY placeholders, it does has each consequences if YOU use one of my (${this.client.user.username}) commands 
        and yes... I'll never tell what are those consequences, since it's troublesome, REALLY really REALLY reallly troublesome, more TrOuBlEsOmE than nursing a baby alien from Tamriel\n

        I see you have ${assignedRoles} roles assigned to ${msg.member.nickname ? msg.member.nickname : msg.author.username}
